# Product Filter with Exception Handling (Java)

This Java program reads product data from a `products.csv` file, filters products with price greater than **1000**, and writes them into a new file `filtered_products.csv`.  

It also demonstrates **exception handling** with:
- FileNotFoundException
- NumberFormatException
- Custom exception (InvalidProductDataException)
- try-with-resources for safe file closing
